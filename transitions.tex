\textit{Visually \say{ease} the rate (acceleration) at which objects change their velocity. Preface the following with }\texttt{ease}\textit{, and optionally suffix with one of: }\texttt{In}, \texttt{Out},\textit{ or }\texttt{InOut}\textit{:}\\

\subsec{\href{https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate}{Interpolators}}{d3}
\textit{An }\texttt{interpolator}\textit{ is a function that takes a number }\texttt{i}\textit{$\in [0,1]$ and yields intermediary values in the domain-space of the specific interpolator. The following functions take two parameters that bookend the interpolation range (except for }\texttt{-Discrete}, \texttt{-Basis}\textit{, and }\texttt{-BasisClosed},\textit{ which take a single array), and yield interpolators (for color interpolators, see \say{color} section):}

{\footnotesize
\begin{minipage}[t]{2.0cm}

    -Object\\

    -Svg\\
    -Basis
\end{minipage}
}\\
\textit{The last two are \say{splines}, which produce non-linear interpolators roughly following the given array. In addition, }\texttt{\href{https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-piecewise}{d3.piecewise}}\textit{ generates a piecewise interpolation visiting the $n$ points of its input array, and }\href{https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-quantize}{\texttt{d3.quantize}}\textit{ generates $n$ samples of a passed interpolator.}
